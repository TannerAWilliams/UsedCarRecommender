'''
The Quality Index Rating (QIR)

Offers an overall score based on the frequency of powertrain issues,
the mileage distribution of when those issues take place,
and the car age at the time of trade-in.

You can think of it as a weighted average where we look at a number of factors for a given car model,
and then get a single value indicating itâ€™s overall long-term reliability.
